This site is about me in all aspects of life.  It started as a place to share technology-related things I&#x27;m curious about as they relate to my career but evolved into just something about me.  It&#x27;s important to know more about a person than just what code repositories they have and how they approach modern software development. This tries to cover what&#x27;s important to me and how I approach all things in life, not just software and technology.</p></div><div><h2>Latest Post</h2><div class="post-card"><h3><a href="/posts/user-story-mapping-book">User Story Mapping Book</a></h3><div class="post-content"><div class="post-date">May 27, 2025</div><p>Wandering through the &quot;available now&quot; books on my eBook app for my library and came across this one.

This book is well written and still very useful in terms of guidance and best practices.  I'm sure if I read this every year I'd pull out different quotes and learnings but the fact that any software development book is still relevant a decade in is very indicative of its value and the transformative nature of these concepts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOutput vs Impact\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a never-ending struggle of software development teams being asked to \"go faster\" and \"do more\" but I found the section about \"good teams vs bad teams\" (my renaming of the section) to be an intriguing angle on this struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the common misconceptions in software development is that we're trying to get more output faster.  Because it would make sense that if there was too much to do, doing it faster would help, right?  But if you get the game right, you will realize that your job is not to build \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e--it's to build \u003cem\u003eless\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, your job is to \u003cem\u003eminimize\u003c/em\u003e output, and \u003cem\u003emaximize\u003c/em\u003e outcome and impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can always ship more code and we can do things to ship more code faster.  Increasingly I see posts about AI-driven development being a game-changer in this way.  AI can \u003cem\u003ecertainly\u003c/em\u003e help us ship more code faster, of that I have no doubt.  However these quotes are spot-on in that we shouldn't be focused on the quantity of output.  Whether we measure in lines of code, issues, closed, deployments made, or any other GitLab-driven metric we're stuck without the whole picture.  The \u003cem\u003equality\u003c/em\u003e of the product that comes out of those metrics is what truly matters.  And that is a very difficult metric to track and correlate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"/posts/user-story-mapping-book"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"HE7UTibQg7SOW13UECxL0","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
