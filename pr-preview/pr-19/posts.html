This book is well written and still very useful in terms of guidance and best practices.  I'm sure if I read this every year I'd pull out different quotes and learnings but the fact that any software development book is still relevant a decade in is very indicative of its value and the transformative nature of these concepts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOutput vs Impact\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a never-ending struggle of software development teams being asked to \"go faster\" and \"do more\" but I found the section about \"good teams vs bad teams\" (my renaming of the section) to be an intriguing angle on this struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the common misconceptions in software development is that we're trying to get more output faster.  Because it would make sense that if there was too much to do, doing it faster would help, right?  But if you get the game right, you will realize that your job is not to build \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e--it's to build \u003cem\u003eless\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, your job is to \u003cem\u003eminimize\u003c/em\u003e output, and \u003cem\u003emaximize\u003c/em\u003e outcome and impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can always ship more code and we can do things to ship more code faster.  Increasingly I see posts about AI-driven development being a game-changer in this way.  AI can \u003cem\u003ecertainly\u003c/em\u003e help us ship more code faster, of that I have no doubt.  However these quotes are spot-on in that we shouldn't be focused on the quantity of output.  Whether we measure in lines of code, issues, closed, deployments made, or any other GitLab-driven metric we're stuck without the whole picture.  The \u003cem\u003equality\u003c/em\u003e of the product that comes out of those metrics is what truly matters.  And that is a very difficult metric to track and correlate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"/posts/user-story-mapping-book"},{"slugPartial":"camping-car-storage","filename":"camping-car-storage","title":"Camping Car Storage","excerpt":"We do a big road trip with tent camping every year and it was time to build something custom.","date":"2025-05-25","categories":["wood","camping"],"ogImage":{"url":"posts/camping-car-storage/thumbnail.jpg"},"images":[{"ref":"![](initial-prototype.jpg)","altText":"A black SUV's trunk is open, showing a cooler and two wooden crates inside.","filename":"initial-prototype.jpg","title":""},{"ref":"![](drawers-prototype.jpg)","altText":"The back of an SUV with a Coleman cooler and two crates in the trunk.","filename":"drawers-prototype.jpg","title":""},{"ref":"![](realish-drawers.jpg)","altText":"The back of an SUV with a Coleman cooler and various camping supplies on display.","filename":"realish-drawers.jpg","title":""}],"content":"\u003cp\u003eFor essentially as long as we've had our Outback I've thought about building something that fits nicely into the back to make our camping setup more organized and just how we need it.  We've had a very similar setup for that entire time that is comprised for four things:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOur Coleman stainless steel cooler,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSome cheap Sterilite drawers from Target that serves as our drawers and cabinets for pots, pans, silverware, towels, dishes, and whatever else we throw in there,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA nearly-discarded drawer box from our kitchen remodel that wasn't quite the right size that serves as our food box, and\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAll sorts of random bags, totes, boxes, and other ways to cram stuff into the back of the car.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile some custom-made storage isn't going to solve for #1 (or #4) it could make an improvement on #2 and #3 right off the bat and maybe even start to infringe upon #4's territory as we refine it to our needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eInitial Prototype\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I've been big on \u003cem\u003esoftware prototypes\u003c/em\u003e for my whole career the idea of \u003cem\u003ewoodworking prototypes\u003c/em\u003e is still pretty new for me.  It started when we were configuring the bathroom I was going to put into the basement and I needed a to-scale toilet, vanity, and shower.  For this one it was just to get a sense for how to work around the liner that protects the floor of the back area as well as give more clear visual cues for how this might all start to go for sizing and the angle of the seatback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/posts/camping-car-storage/initial-prototype.jpg\" alt=\"A black SUV\u0026#x27;s trunk is open, showing a cooler and two wooden crates inside.\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDrawers Prototype\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext step was to break that down a bit into something representing the individual \"cabinets\" and the drawers that our stuff would go into.  This helped to further shape the mental model of how this would all fit and gave me something tangible to see for what all we could fit into this space and how it would work together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/posts/camping-car-storage/drawers-prototype.jpg\" alt=\"The back of an SUV with a Coleman cooler and two crates in the trunk.\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most important thing this identified for me was that the cooler couldn't sit in the middle.  None of these drawers were going to be large enough to fit the pots and pans (which are the largest single thing to store).  So any real implementaiton would need to include a larger drawer on one side or the other to fit those.  This would also make it so the drawers on that side are also large enough for the plates and bowls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eReal-ish Drawers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding off that I felt like I had a decent idea of how this could all work and was starting to run low on time before our 2025 trip so I kind of just went for it.  I built some real drawers and got actual drawer slides.  These are push-to-open drawer slides so they will stay closed while we're driving (a problem we had with the plastic drawers that required a bungee which was not fun to deal with).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first iteration that got revealed to the family (most importantly Trephaena) and the reviews were pretty positive.  The cooler drawer is pretty sweet and the overall idea is great.

I created a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/arsdehnel/bedrock-exploration\"\u003equick repo\u003c/a\u003e to play around with it, capture some scripts, and see where it led.  It was my first real development calling models in a way that would be used for anything semi-real.  I'd done some scripts and \u003ccode\u003ecurl\u003c/code\u003e commands to call chatGPT and all that but this had a bit more purpose behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eInitial Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very first thing you have to do in the console is follow a couple ClickOps things to enable access to the models which is a little awkward.  I get why it needs to be there to avoid accidental spend on a model that could cost a lot of money but it's not the easiest onboarding experience especially because of how the AWS console continues to struggle with good UX.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that the experience was actually pretty good.  Once you have a model you can use (the access is granted immediately after finding the flow to request it) there is a playground setup that makes it very easy to interact with them.  This is similar to other AI model interactions, they didn't invent anything new here but also didn't try to be clever like AWS sometimes does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin a few minutes I had a model setup and was making the requests I needed to prove out the use cases I had in mind.  This was easier than I expected and rather pleasant.  I was fooled into thinking this was going to be flawless exploration 😉.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMoving to the SDK\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point I figured I was ready to take those clicks I was doing in the console and turn them into some SDK calls.  Being the JavaScript developer that I am I created a \u003ccode\u003egit\u003c/code\u003e repo and installed \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-client-bedrock-runtime/\"\u003ethe AWS SDK for Bedrock Runtime\u003c/a\u003e.  So far so good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever moving on to the \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-client-bedrock-runtime/Interface/InvokeModelCommandInput/\"\u003eInvoke Model Command\u003c/a\u003e and it's only input the \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-client-bedrock-runtime/Interface/InvokeModelCommandInput/\"\u003eInvoke Model Command Input\u003c/a\u003e I hit my first stumbling block.  There is essentially no documentation for this method.  Since this is AWS I just figured it wasn't in the SDK docs but that it was somewhere on the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Bedrock is just a system that runs a variety of models for you the runtime SDK is essentially just an AWS authentication wrapper on the models themselves.  So every model takes a different input and even within models your input might need to be different based on what you are trying to do.  That totally makes sense in hindsight but compared to essentially any other AWS service I've used it's not how they work.  And there doens't seem to be any indication of this anywhere in their docs.  No pointers to suggest that each model is different and you should refer to the docs of that model instead of anything within AWS. Maybe people more familiar with the AI/Model space would know this more readily but I sure didn't and it got quite frustrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eInitial Scripts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I got past that stumbling block I got things scripted out pretty easily.  The \u003ccode\u003eModel ID\u003c/code\u003e the API requires isn't \u003cem\u003equite\u003c/em\u003e what the console provides but you just need to prefix the provided ID with \u003ccode\u003eus.\u003c/code\u003e and things work.  Another undocumented thing but not the worst thing to struggle through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first few things were based roughly on asks from the business at work.  While this wasn't on the clock work or even things we were being directly asked to do they were real requirements that I could easily script for to help me figure out how to use Bedrock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlt Text Generation: give a model an image and get back a description of the image to be used as Alt Text to improve the accessibility of our site.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEcard Generator: we have a mechanism for sending ecards to coworkers on our site so having AI generate a card for you right in the system seemed pretty handy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnhance: generic AI text interaction where it can take something you wrote and make it more professional or heart-felt (ironically).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile these were pretty simple use cases and all are done with prebuilt models it was a good toe-dipping exercise.  While I had some frustration with the AWS API I still was able to get something useful and learn a fair bit about how Bedrock works and where it could be useful.  I'm sure it's not always the most efficient method for running models but it sure is easy and I'm not going to stand up my own model for home projects so having something that's super easy to use and can be baked right into the rest of my infrastructure bill is a welcome option.\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"/posts/aws-bedrock-exploration"}],"categories":["book","camping","cloud tech","development","wood"]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts","query":{},"buildId":"HE7UTibQg7SOW13UECxL0","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
