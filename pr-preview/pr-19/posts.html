I started at \u003ca href=\"https://www.improving.com/\"\u003eImproving\u003c/a\u003e as a Principal Consultant on August 11th and it's been a really wild ride since then.  Having spent nearly 21 years at \u003ca href=\"https://www.biworldwide.com/\"\u003eBI Worldwide\u003c/a\u003e as a FTE there are quite a few things to adjust to moving into consulting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLearning Upon Learning\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith any job change, whether at a new role in the same company or at an entirely new company, there is learning involved.  However I've found there to be far more aspects to this learning than I expected.  During the couple weeks between turning in my resignation and starting at Improving I was thinking about learning GCP and Grafana best practices (both part of my first project).  But once I got started I realized just how much I didn't know.  New commute, new door system, new HR system, new office layout, new inter-department dynamics, new computer configurations, and so many other new things I won't bother listing them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be clear here though: this was incredibly exciting and even exhilarating.  I love learning and new challenges, both of which I now have in abundance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGood in All the Right Ways\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout this transition --and even before I really started looking for a new job-- I have spent a lot of time thinking about what is important to me. I had to determine what I was hoping to get out of a change if for no other reason than to be clear I wasn't leaving out of spite. In talking to people in my life about this change and how it's going I have often used the phrase that this job is \"better in all the ways that I wanted it to be better\" which sounds very superficial, but it really reflects how I'm feeling. There were some parts of my old job that were pretty awesome, but they just did not outweigh the terrible parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's a really weird feeling, though, to be working on something that isn't really mine and that I'm gonna be walking away from after a few months. After all, I spent the last decade of my life building an entire ecosystem from scratch.  However, now that I'm a quarter in I can say that I really thought that I would miss this far more than I do. Maybe at some point in the future I will want to get back to something long-term that I get to control the roadmap on but for right now this seemingly negative thing is actually a complete non-issue. In fact, the transition from project to project is still quite exciting to me and will help me learn more technologies, more things about business and most importantly, more things about myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMissing Friends\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar and away my biggest concern with leaving and the biggest reason that I stayed at BIW as long as I did were the amazing friends that I got to work with every day. Some of them I've been friends with for nearly half my life and the idea that I got to work with them was really special. I can't even really come up with the words to try and convey how heart wrenching it was to make the decision to end that era in my life. As I've told them: one key part of this new era is to make sure that I stay connected to them and they continue to be part of my life. I'm still figuring this out and learning how to be just friends with them and not coworkers that I'm also friends with. In some ways, it's very freeing and exciting to get to know them without the baggage of work but it certainly takes a lot more effort to see them and keep up with them now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Irony\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt definitely is not lost on me that the mission of my new company is exactly what is at the core of what I think is wrong with my old company. Our mission (in my own words) is to help companies learn to trust and value their technology organizations. The lack of this trust was evident to me for years at BIW but I had been feeling like their opinions were changing until earlier this year when leadership made it clear how they still felt. The lightness I feel in conversations and in my daily work that results from this significant change really can't be put into words. Over all the years I had clearly become numb to how this impacted me both during my working day and outside of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLooking Ahead\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, I'm very convinced that this was the right decision for me. I didn't really have concerns that it wasn't but I'm far enough into it now that I am absolutely certain. I'm really looking forward to continuing to settle in to this new job and pattern of learning and everything that it brings to my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"/posts/consulting-one-month"},{"slugPartial":"user-story-mapping-book","filename":"user-story-mapping-book.md","title":"User Story Mapping Book","excerpt":"Wandering through the \"available now\" books on my eBook app for my library and came across this one.

This book is well written and still very useful in terms of guidance and best practices.  I'm sure if I read this every year I'd pull out different quotes and learnings but the fact that any software development book is still relevant a decade in is very indicative of its value and the transformative nature of these concepts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOutput vs Impact\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a never-ending struggle of software development teams being asked to \"go faster\" and \"do more\" but I found the section about \"good teams vs bad teams\" (my renaming of the section) to be an intriguing angle on this struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the common misconceptions in software development is that we're trying to get more output faster.  Because it would make sense that if there was too much to do, doing it faster would help, right?  But if you get the game right, you will realize that your job is not to build \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e--it's to build \u003cem\u003eless\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, your job is to \u003cem\u003eminimize\u003c/em\u003e output, and \u003cem\u003emaximize\u003c/em\u003e outcome and impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can always ship more code and we can do things to ship more code faster.  Increasingly I see posts about AI-driven development being a game-changer in this way.  AI can \u003cem\u003ecertainly\u003c/em\u003e help us ship more code faster, of that I have no doubt.  However these quotes are spot-on in that we shouldn't be focused on the quantity of output.

We've had a very similar setup for that entire time that is comprised for four things:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOur Coleman stainless steel cooler,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSome cheap Sterilite drawers from Target that serves as our drawers and cabinets for pots, pans, silverware, towels, dishes, and whatever else we throw in there,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA nearly-discarded drawer box from our kitchen remodel that wasn't quite the right size that serves as our food box, and\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAll sorts of random bags, totes, boxes, and other ways to cram stuff into the back of the car.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile some custom-made storage isn't going to solve for #1 (or #4) it could make an improvement on #2 and #3 right off the bat and maybe even start to infringe upon #4's territory as we refine it to our needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eInitial Prototype\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I've been big on \u003cem\u003esoftware prototypes\u003c/em\u003e for my whole career the idea of \u003cem\u003ewoodworking prototypes\u003c/em\u003e is still pretty new for me.  It started when we were configuring the bathroom I was going to put into the basement and I needed a to-scale toilet, vanity, and shower.  For this one it was just to get a sense for how to work around the liner that protects the floor of the back area as well as give more clear visual cues for how this might all start to go for sizing and the angle of the seatback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/posts/camping-car-storage/initial-prototype.jpg\" alt=\"A black SUV\u0026#x27;s trunk is open, showing a cooler and two wooden crates inside.\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDrawers Prototype\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext step was to break that down a bit into something representing the individual \"cabinets\" and the drawers that our stuff would go into.  This helped to further shape the mental model of how this would all fit and gave me something tangible to see for what all we could fit into this space and how it would work together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/posts/camping-car-storage/drawers-prototype.jpg\" alt=\"The back of an SUV with a Coleman cooler and two crates in the trunk.\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most important thing this identified for me was that the cooler couldn't sit in the middle.  None of these drawers were going to be large enough to fit the pots and pans (which are the largest single thing to store).  So any real implementaiton would need to include a larger drawer on one side or the other to fit those.  This would also make it so the drawers on that side are also large enough for the plates and bowls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eReal-ish Drawers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding off that I felt like I had a decent idea of how this could all work and was starting to run low on time before our 2025 trip so I kind of just went for it.  I built some real drawers and got actual drawer slides.  These are push-to-open drawer slides so they will stay closed while we're driving (a problem we had with the plastic drawers that required a bungee which was not fun to deal with).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first iteration that got revealed to the family (most importantly Trephaena) and the reviews were pretty positive.  The cooler drawer is pretty sweet and the overall idea is great.  One drawer was being annoying to get to latch in place and the left drawers are pretty tight but otherwise it was definitely a success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/posts/camping-car-storage/realish-drawers.jpg\" alt=\"The back of an SUV with a Coleman cooler and various camping supplies on display.\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWork-in-Progress\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe're discussing what more we want to try to do before we leave (two weeks from today) so we'll see where we land on that.  For now this is going to come with us and we'll test it on the road.

I created a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/arsdehnel/bedrock-exploration\"\u003equick repo\u003c/a\u003e to play around with it, capture some scripts, and see where it led.  It was my first real development calling models in a way that would be used for anything semi-real.  I'd done some scripts and \u003ccode\u003ecurl\u003c/code\u003e commands to call chatGPT and all that but this had a bit more purpose behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eInitial Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very first thing you have to do in the console is follow a couple ClickOps things to enable access to the models which is a little awkward.  I get why it needs to be there to avoid accidental spend on a model that could cost a lot of money but it's not the easiest onboarding experience especially because of how the AWS console continues to struggle with good UX.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that the experience was actually pretty good.  Once you have a model you can use (the access is granted immediately after finding the flow to request it) there is a playground setup that makes it very easy to interact with them.  This is similar to other AI model interactions, they didn't invent anything new here but also didn't try to be clever like AWS sometimes does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin a few minutes I had a model setup and was making the requests I needed to prove out the use cases I had in mind.  This was easier than I expected and rather pleasant.  I was fooled into thinking this was going to be flawless exploration 😉.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMoving to the SDK\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point I figured I was ready to take those clicks I was doing in the console and turn them into some SDK calls.  Being the JavaScript developer that I am I created a \u003ccode\u003egit\u003c/code\u003e repo and installed \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-client-bedrock-runtime/\"\u003ethe AWS SDK for Bedrock Runtime\u003c/a\u003e.  So far so good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever moving on to the \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-client-bedrock-runtime/Interface/InvokeModelCommandInput/\"\u003eInvoke Model Command\u003c/a\u003e and it's only input the \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-client-bedrock-runtime/Interface/InvokeModelCommandInput/\"\u003eInvoke Model Command Input\u003c/a\u003e I hit my first stumbling block.  There is essentially no documentation for this method.  Since this is AWS I just figured it wasn't in the SDK docs but that it was somewhere on the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Bedrock is just a system that runs a variety of models for you the runtime SDK is essentially just an AWS authentication wrapper on the models themselves.  So every model takes a different input and even within models your input might need to be different based on what you are trying to do.  That totally makes sense in hindsight but compared to essentially any other AWS service I've used it's not how they work.  And there doens't seem to be any indication of this anywhere in their docs.  No pointers to suggest that each model is different and you should refer to the docs of that model instead of anything within AWS. Maybe people more familiar with the AI/Model space would know this more readily but I sure didn't and it got quite frustrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eInitial Scripts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I got past that stumbling block I got things scripted out pretty easily.  The \u003ccode\u003eModel ID\u003c/code\u003e the API requires isn't \u003cem\u003equite\u003c/em\u003e what the console provides but you just need to prefix the provided ID with \u003ccode\u003eus.\u003c/code\u003e and things work.  Another undocumented thing but not the worst thing to struggle through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first few things were based roughly on asks from the business at work.  While this wasn't on the clock work or even things we were being directly asked to do they were real requirements that I could easily script for to help me figure out how to use Bedrock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlt Text Generation: give a model an image and get back a description of the image to be used as Alt Text to improve the accessibility of our site.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEcard Generator: we have a mechanism for sending ecards to coworkers on our site so having AI generate a card for you right in the system seemed pretty handy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnhance: generic AI text interaction where it can take something you wrote and make it more professional or heart-felt (ironically).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile these were pretty simple use cases and all are done with prebuilt models it was a good toe-dipping exercise.  While I had some frustration with the AWS API I still was able to get something useful and learn a fair bit about how Bedrock works and where it could be useful.  I'm sure it's not always the most efficient method for running models but it sure is easy and I'm not going to stand up my own model for home projects so having something that's super easy to use and can be baked right into the rest of my infrastructure bill is a welcome option.\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"/posts/aws-bedrock-exploration"}],"categories":["book","camping","career","cloud tech","development","wood"]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts","query":{},"buildId":"F3ZEkX1hw-34JsQGbLr6P","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
