			<h3>Youngster Hack</h3>
			<p>Growing up I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do &emdash; probably like most kids after we pass the age of thinking we could be a superhero and realize that being a professional athlete or move star is quite the long shot. Got our first desktop computer for Christmas in 1993 and looking back on it I see now it was the first thing that I really felt like I loved to do and was good at. I mean it was Windows 2.5 and seeing what I could do with a `.bat` file injected into the boot sequence on a 386SX running at a cracking 16Mhz but somehow that was _so fun_.</p>
