I still knew employer has a series of meetings every month under the title "Come Together" as a way to share topics and ideas as well as build community in ways that are just not normally exposed internally within a company. The topics of these are monthly and past sessions have covered individual countries that we have offices in as well as the concept of playing games as part of building a company and teams. This month's topic is kind of tied to men and male health, which I'll be honest isn't my favorite. It feels kind of cringe. Not that I want to ignore it or dismiss it, quite the opposite actually. I think men's health is really important and often men ignore it and pretend they're invincible. It just is that my first impression was kind of part of the pushback on things like the me too movement and sort of the "reverse sexism" talk track.

## Initial Conversation

Today's session was about being leaders in a global company, the challenges they face and tools tips, and techniques to deal with the stress and balance.  I'm not entirely sure what it was about the description that caught my attention and made me make sure that I dialed in and that I wasn't multitasking and getting distracted, but I'm glad it happened.  I still was a little bit multitasking, but I really can't imagine myself ever just sitting there watching some Talking Heads for an hour without doing anything else. At the beginning of this session, I felt really guilty about what I was doing, but as you'll see through my processing and analysis, it turns out I shouldn't have felt that way. I always have plenty of projects going in the garage and I decided that that sort of project could keep me busy while allowing my brain to still process the discussion that was happening on the meeting.

The initial parts of the meeting were interesting, but sort of in a superficial sort of way. They talked about ways to deal with stress and how long they had been doing jobs like this, and that sort of thing. The speakers were our CEO and the leaders of some global offices all of them are successful men that really fit a stereotype I often roll my eyes at (middle-aged successful men running technology companies worth tens and hundreds of millions of dollars). These particular individuals are not cringe, but it's hard for me to listen to them. Talk about how they manage life stress without a little bit of feeling that my life is very different from their life. That is probably true, but as the talk went on, it was good to hear what they had to say and see them as more levelheaded and relatable people than I gave them credit for.

## Integrated Life




Leaders: I generally am not a big fan of the idea of “men” being the topic for November but I’m trying to avoid getting hung up on it.  Parts of today’s session were a little eye rolley but the part I’m really spending a lot of time processing is when they were talking about “work life balance” and how it is maybe not the best way to think about it especially in a modern remote world.  My first reaction was “ugh” because it sounded like it was going to be “gotta always be connected” but Curtis’ “integrated lifestyle” was described in terms that very closely aligned to what I am trying to achieve with my life now that I’m at Improving.  If the kids have a thing in the morning then go do it.  If you want to go for a walk with your wife or go shopping for the kids at 11am then do it.  Maybe that works best for you and you’re fine working later so you are still getting your job done.  8-5 workdays aren’t for everyone and don’t force yourself into that if you don’t have to.
